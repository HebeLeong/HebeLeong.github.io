                    <p>My name is Hebe Leong, Iâ€™m 15 years old and I am a form 4 student in Sacred Heart Canossian College English Section (SHCCES). I like to play tennis and guitar, I have also attended few tennis competitions as I was in the Macau Tennis Team before. My goal in the follow three years is to take the guitar grand 5 examination and learn French.I am also hoping to achieve my English skills and make friends with my fellow schoolmates in the following few years. :D
